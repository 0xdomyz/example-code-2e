- Every Python object has an identity, a type, and a value, and only the value of an
     object may change over time.
- Immutable objects with equal values and immutable collections with ref to mut.
- Variables hold references:

    - assignment
    - augmented assignment
    - rebinding
    - function parameters
    - function default values

- garbage collection
    - reference counting
    - cyclic garbage collection
- weak references
