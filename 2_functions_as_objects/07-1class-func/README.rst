- first-class nature of functions

    - can assign functions to variables
    - pass them to other functions
    - store them in data structures
    - access function attributes, allowing frameworks and tools to act on that information.
    - Higher-order functions: sorted, min, and max, and functools.partial, 
        map, filter, reduce, reducing built-ins like sum, all, and any.

- Callables

    - the simple functions created with lambda
    - classes implementing __call__
    - Generators and coroutines
    
- callable()
- the operator module
- functools.partial
