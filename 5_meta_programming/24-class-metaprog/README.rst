- attributes found in class objects, such
    as __qualname__ and the __subclasses__() method
- the type built-in can be used to construct classes at runtime.
- __init_subclass__
- @checked class decorator that adds
    features to user-defined classes
- can not dynamically configure __slots__
- import time” and “runtime”, modules,
    descriptors, class decorators, and __init_subclass__ is involved.
- metaclasses, type as a metaclass, __new__, __slots__, __prepare__, __new__
- Field descriptors and custom __slots__ configuration
- considerations about metaclass usage in practice.
- AutoConst hack, __prepare__ returning a mapping that
    implements __missing__
